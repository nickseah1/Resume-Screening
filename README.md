# Resume Screening

The purpose of this project is to build a classifier that can take a resume as an input and output what type of resume it belongs to. This is a NLP problem and we will use the Tfid Vectorizer to learn the vocabulary and use the K-Nearest-Neighbors Algorithm to train the data.

Through these techniques we were able to build a classifier that predicted the correct type of resume 98% of the time on Test Data.
